# Appointment Planner
## Project #51 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
The aim of this project is to use React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts, and one to view and add appointments.

This app was implemented from the topmost component down. Both stateful and stateless functional components were created using hooks.
## What I Learned
  - General React features I have studied previously, but with increased complexity
  - Stateful components (App, ContactsPage, and AppointmentsPage in this project)
  - Stateless components (ContactForm, TileList, Tile, and AppointmentForm)
  - Using the spread operator (...) in callback functions to set the new state
  - useState and useEffect hooks
  - Using phone number regex to include a pattern attribute to the input
